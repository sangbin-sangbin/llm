The vehicle does not use its electric motor as an independent drive, but turns it on to support the combustion engine depending on the situation. This reduces fuel consumption and increases range. At the same time, the electric drive can boost the combustion engine. In vehicles with \"mild hybrid technology\", the battery is recharged by recuperation on the go only while braking. When braking, for example at a traffic light, the engine is already turned off at a speed of about 10mph."
